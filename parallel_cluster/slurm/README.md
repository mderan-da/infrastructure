# SLURM

Lots to write here

Explain that the endpoint.txt and passwd.txt need to be created and uploaded to S3.
So that they can connect to the SLURM RDS instance.

Also need to write about memory and CPU restrictions, these under-utilise the servers
somewhat but prevent jobs needed to restart or being stuck due to memory being thrown into swap.
